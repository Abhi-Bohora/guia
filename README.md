# App Guide - Sovereinia

**Welcome Hackathoners!**  
This project is participating in the OnlyDust Open Source Hackathon! See below for how to get involved.

The **App Guide** is an interactive tool to help people discover and compare decentralized, self-hosted platforms. It presents alternatives to centralized services and highlights how these technologies promote autonomy, privacy, and digital sovereignty. It is focused on the Brazilian audience, hence why it's in Portuguese, but we want to add more languages!
